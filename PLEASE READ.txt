IMPORTANT: Java Environment Setup Guide
If you encounter issues related to the Java Environment path, follow these steps:
1. Open the "settings.json" file in your project.
2. Update the "path" and "sources" fields with the correct Java Environment location.
3. To find your Java Environment path, use the provided script:
   Step-by-step:
   a. Open the VSCode terminal.
   b. Navigate to the utils directory:
      cd utils
   c. Run the script:
      find_java.bat
   Alternatively, you can run the script directly from any terminal by entering the full path, like:
   D:\GitHub\DataMiningProject\utils\find_java.bat
This will print out the correct path to your Java environment. Copy that path and use it in your settings.json.
