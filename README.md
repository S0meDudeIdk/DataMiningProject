# DataMiningProject

Here are three files can be implement independently

1. DataCleaner.java
Can be built right away using raw .csv file.

Only needs to define the input/output structure.

Output: cleaned_data.csv

2. ARFFConverter.java
Can be built at the same time as DataCleaner by using a sample cleaned CSV to test with.

You can hardcode a mini CSV during testing before getting real cleaned data.

3. ClassifierModel.java
You can use existing .arff files (like weather_classification.arff) to test this without needing real input from your team yet.

Implement the training and basic evaluation part.
